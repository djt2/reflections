What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a repository to track future changes is created. .git file is created.
We need to create a repository to reflect all the changes in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is before committing. Working directory is the directory which contains the files we're trying to make changes and commit to the repository.

staging area offers us the flexibility to use a single commit to use on more than one files.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We can add multiple files to the staging area. The files that cantains the changes logically inter-related should be added to the staging area.
Then using git commit we add a message and add the files in the staging area to the repository.
