When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my work with others. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
My repository is public. So anyone can contribute to it. If someone else updates
my repository I might not want to include that to my repository or it might affect my code
as everyone operates with their own logic

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When I want to copy someone else's remote on github to my account,I use fork.
Copying from my remote to my local repository is called cloning.
Branches are useful for parallel or experimental development of same code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When there is update on remote as well as local we can see
what the conflict is between the two and resolve it
before we push the updated changes that icorporates both the changes 
to the remote.
