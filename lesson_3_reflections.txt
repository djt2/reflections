When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my work with others. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
My repository is public. So anyone can contribute to it. If someone else updates
my repository I might not want to include that to my repository or it might affect my code
as everyone operates with their own logic
